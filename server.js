/*
ROUTES:
root (/) --> response = this is working

/signin --> will be a POST request (json) will respond with either a success or fail.  As it is a password nned to POST so it is inside the body using https and not query string.

/register - POST request - we want to add the date to a variable in our server - will return new user object

/profile/:userId --> will have a profile with user id so we need to GET user information

/image --> PUT as we are updating rank score
